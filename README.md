# BTK Machine Learning Course

These are my notes from the machine learning course I took on the BTK platform.

I used Google Colaboratory (python notebook) for programming.

Used data files are noted in notebooks and they are in the Data Files folder.

#

*First homework* is to predict whether tennis game will play or not.

*Second homework* is to create 5 different model of regression for salary prediction.

*Third homework* is to analyze iris dataset, compare results and visualize data.
