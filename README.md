# BTK Machine Learning Course

These are my notes from the machine learning course I took on the BTK platform presented by Şadi Evren ŞEKER.

I used Google Colaboratory (python notebook) for programming.

Used data files are noted in notebooks and they are in the Data Files folder.

#

*First homework* is to predict whether tennis game will play or not.

*Second homework* is to create 5 different model of regression for salary prediction.

*Third homework* is to analyze iris dataset, compare results and visualize data.

**Notebook File Topics**:

BTK_1: **data frames**.

BTK_2: **simple, multiple and polynomial linear regression**.

BTK_3: **support vector regression, decision trees, random forest and r2 value calculation**.

BTK-4: **classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes)**.

BTK-5: **clustering (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Association Rule Mining(ARM, Eclat))**.

BTK-6: **Reinforced Learning(upper confidence bound, thomson sampling)**.

BTK-7: **Natural Language Processing**.

BTK-8: **Artificial Neural Networks, Dimension Reduction (PCA and LDA), Model Evaluation (k-fold validation, grid search), XGBoost classifier**.

BTK-9: **Saving model to reuse, CNN**
